### Here is my project submission for [Female Daily Network]🐟!

> This is a web server built using [Nest.js] about Users. This project is using [Postgresql] as DB and [Docker] to containerize this web server. This project is using [MikroORM] as the ORM.

🎉 These are the current features:
- Fetch and Store Users data from external source
- CRUD Operations on Users

How to run the development server:
```bash
$ yarn install
then
$ docker-compose up -d
then
$ yarn run start:dev
```

## 🔨 Thoughts
🤔💭 If I had more time, these are some things that I would like to improve ...
- move the Authorization Header of `deleteUser()` to a seperate `Auth Guard`
- fix the `@IsEmailAlreadyExists()` decorator bug
- create unit testing with Supertest and Jest

Well, I guess that's about it! Thank you for visiting. I'd love to connect more with you! Email me at katherinedavenia24@gmail.com and find me on Linkedin! [<img alt="Linkedin" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-blue?style=social&logo=linkedin">][linkedin]. Cheers!🥂
